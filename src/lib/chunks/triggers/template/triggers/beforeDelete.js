/**
 * Before delete trigger.
 * You can run custom Cloud Code before an object is deleted.
 * You can do this with the beforeDelete method.
 * For instance, this can be used to implement a restricted delete policy that is more sophisticated than what can be expressed through ACLs.
 * For example, suppose you have a photo album app, where many photos are associated with each album, and you want to prevent the user from deleting an album if it still has a photo in it.
 * https://docs.servable.app/docs/features/api/triggers
 * https://docs.parseplatform.org/cloudcode/guide/#delete-triggers
 * @return {void} Always returns void.
 * @param {Object} request Parse server request.
