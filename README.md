**Servable** is a Node JS framework built on top of Express JS and Parse Server and tailored for features. It provides a concise, easy to use and scalable template to get the best of Parse Server and features.

Servable at its core is a server template that uses the toolbox-servable to orchestrate the different features used in an application. Servable streamlines the server development by separating every "groupable" logic to be a feature, so that it is organically extracted from the base code and possibly migrated into its own package. By doing so, Servable enforces a clear separation of concerns pattern out of the box.

Main features:
- Quick start and Plug & Play Node JS framework
- Tailored for features
- Schema based classes and auto-migration
- Templates for classes
- Templates for custom features


Just like a docker image is made to be platform agnostic, a feature is designed to be independant from the current environment it's being used in. A feature might depend on other features, but it does not need to know which application it is used for, or call any of its API.

The Servable object acts as a central orchestrator. It holds references to objects every feature can access (for example the current express app, the Parse Server instance, etc). It can also be used to register special methods provided by features and that might be used by other features, without knowing the source feature of the method. For example, an emailable feature if declared in a ServableApp object will register its implementation of a **sendWithTemplate** method in Servable.Emailing. This API will be used by other features to send emails by following its specific specification.

## Why Servable?
At @anak we created the features in our Node JS + Parse server project. What was an experience to ease the backend development quickly became a good practice that helped us keep a clean codebase. They worked so well we decided to streamline their integration with the code base for future projects. We were inspired by the powerful ways NextJs improved the React experience by providing an efficient template on top of it. Yet we did not want to hide the Parse Server framework behind ours as we truly love Parse. Servable allows to tap into all the existing and upcoming Parse features and yet it dramatically simplifies the development process. A well designed Servable project will comprise almost nothing more than the actual classes and business logic of the platform, other repetitive functions and logics will use existing features implemented by the community or entreprise-private features.

## Should you use Servable?
Servable is likely a good fit for you if
- You want to group the development of your server by capacity
- You want to reuse a capacity (feature) over different models without copying it over and over
- You want to make that capacity available throughout your organization or publish it on the web
- You are building a new platform from scratch but you don't want reinvent the wheel for the usual suspects: social interactions, versionning, data consistency over deletion

**...you love Parse Server**
There is no reason not to use Servable if you have previously used a Parse Server.

**...you care about productivity and developer experience**
Servable provides a predetermined template that sets a clear developer's guideline

## Servable in your stack
Servable comes bundled with Parse Server that sets up a working set of tables that handle users, sessions and installation. You can use it to bootstrap your platform or as a microservice that you can access through REST or GraphQL without using the _User, Session and installation tables.
